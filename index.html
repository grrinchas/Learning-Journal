                    This is eight-week since I started to learn <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr>
                    and <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS3</abbr> and today I will cover flexbox - new
                    <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS3</abbr> box model and also I will review my own
                    website.

                <p> Flex layout is superficially similar to block layout. It lacks many of the more complex text- or
                    document-centric properties that can be used in block layouts, such as floats and columns. In
                    return,
                    it
                    gains simple and powerful tools for distributing space and aligning content in ways that web apps
                    and
                    complex web pages often need.

            <p>
                First of all from specification we can see that flexbox is a layout similar to block layout used
                for
                easy distribution of space and content alignment. At first, flex layout may seem too complicated, but
                when you start to get using it, you will see that with this layout you can accomplish hard tasks
                easy.
            </p>

                <img src="images/flexbox.svg" alt="flex box">
                <figcaption>Flexbox container. Original by
                    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/">w3 specification</a>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                This picture illustrates flexbox container. The <i>main axis</i> - is the primary axis along which
                <i>flex items</i> are layout. <i>Flex items</i> are placed in container starting at <i>main
                start</i>
                and
                ending at the <i>main end</i>. The <i>main size</i> is <i>flex item</i> width or height. <i>Cross
                axis</i>
                is
                axis perpendicular to the <i>main axis</i>. To declare element flex:
            </p>
                <pre><code><!--
                --><span>.container&nbsp;{</span>&NewLine;<!--
                -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tag">display:&nbsp;</span><!--
                --><span class="att">flex;</span>&NewLine;<!--
                --><span>}</span><!--
                --></code></pre>
            <p>
                Now all direct children of <i>.container</i> will be flex items. You can specify a
                <i>flex-direction</i>
                default is <i>row</i> but can be a <i>column</i> and others. Also, <i>flex-wrap</i> which wraps items
                if
                needed. With <i>justify-content</i>, you can center element. And to see in practice how flex
                layout looks and behaves check my <a href="guide.html#hotels/">guide page</a>. Also, if you wish to
                read

            <p id="w8_review">
                As promised, I will do a review on my website development. First of all,
                I started to write my website using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">
                IntelliJ IDEA
            </a><abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">ide</abbr> for students. I choose this tool
                because it
                is the most advanced <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">ide</abbr> at this moment. It
                is
                easy
                to use, has very nice code completion and much more. All the testing I did with Google Chrome latest
                version.
                Mainly because this browser is on all my devices. Second I started to develop my Learning Journal
                for
                mobile
                devices
                first, because of this book <a
                    href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Responsive-Web-Design-Beginners/dp/144936294X"> Learning
                Responsive Web Design</a> in which Clarissa Peterson suggested that is always better to design a
                mobile
                version of your website and then desktop, not another way. For this reason, I choose Apple iPhone 4 as
                my
                starting device with a screen width of 320px and scale factor = 1.0. Because I didn't want that my
                website will be narrower than this width, I declared <i>min-width</i> of <i>.wrapper</i> to be 19rem,
                which
                is almost 326px. I don't have any iphone to test how my website looks, but lucky for me Chrome has
                a nice
                tool for this. To activate this feature:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Press right mouse button in the middle of the web page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Choose "inspect element" from the menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the mobile phone icon on the right-hand side of panel top left corner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From left panel device drop down list choose Apple iPhone 4.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Nice thing about this feature that you can check how your website looks on different devices. Bad
                thing
                that it doesn't take account a browser of that device. So I made a <i class="tag">header</i> of
                Learning
                Journal and some <i class="tag">articles</i>. Later I added references at the bottom of my page.
                Everything was good except
                <i class="tag">aside</i> element with a menu, I couldn't fit on my mobile page. At first I though I
                will
                hide it and will be done with it, but that is a bad design decision because mobile users want the same
                functionality as desktop users, and it is really annoying to scroll along the page looking for
                something.
                So I moved my menu to the end of page, just before <i class="tag">footer</i> and added a link to this
                menu
                in the header navigation. When I had a mobile version of my Learning Journal done, to make it responsive
                to
                other devices was a piece of cake. Little by little I increased the size of a page until I noticed that
                page
                doesn't look good anymore, then I took note of screen size in pixels, went to this website
                <a href="http://pxtoem.com/">px to em</a>, converted pixels to ems, and created media query. In
                which
                I increased font size, or moved <i class="tag">aside</i> element on the side, or did something else.
                Please note that
                I did not target specific device width such as iPad or 1024px for laptops. I choose media queries
                entry
                point based on my own perception of a website, except iPhone 4, only because we have to start at
                somewhere.

                <p>
                    This week I have learned about flexible media, which includes images and video. But first I
                    would
                    like
                    to talk about some colour basics (rgba colour model and how to specify colour in <abbr
                        title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>). Also, I will cover some tools which are very useful
                    for developing a website.

            <p id="w7_color_map">
                As we know everything what computers understand is 0's and 1's, because of that we have to have a
                way
                to represent things in the digital word. For characters, we have
                <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> or
                <i>UNICODE</i> schemes which map every character as a number.
                And it is not hard we take the letter 'J' and mapped it to '100 1010' in a binary or '74' in decimal.
                But how to map a colour? How to represent a blue or orange color as a number? Well, we can do it
                like we did with characters. We take any possible color and map it to specific number. The human eye
                can
                differentiate only about 10 million colours so there is no need to map all possible colors in the
                universe.
                And that's the good news, the bad news that we still need to represent 10 million colours.
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichromacy">trichromatic theory</a> says that we can
                only
                recognize three primary colors (red, green and blue). Every
                other colour is a mixed of those three colors. So maybe we can use this principle to map all
                10 million colours as a mix of red, blue and green. We know that with a byte we can represent 256
                possible numeric values. So if take one byte to represent a red, one byte for
                green and one byte for blue, we can have a combination of 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 &#8776; 16.8
                million
                of possible colours. More than we need it.
            </p>

            <hr/>

            <p id="w7_rgb_color_model">
                In the last article, I covered how to represent any color as a mix of red, green and blue. This
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model">color model</a> is called
                <abbr title="RED GREEN BLUE">RGB</abbr> color model. If we add extra opacity value, we will have
                <i>rgba</i> color model.
            </p>

            <p>
                If we want to specify a color for <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> element we can
                do it
                in <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> by providing values for red, green, blue and
                optional
                opacity. We can do it in decimal format, or in hexadecimal. The advantage of using hex format that
                is
                shorter and more readable. The disadvantage that we can't represent opacity. Another way to specify
                a
                color is to use color names. Here are some css examples:

            <p id="w7_digital_images">
                You often hear term "digital image", but what that means? It means that image is represented as
                digits
                (usually binary) opposed to paper image. It has two dimensions, which is a very fancy word for width
                and
                height. Also, there are two types of digital images:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>raster image</i> - which has fixed size of pixels. So if you increase the size of an image it
                    will
                    lose quality because a computer will take the best guest which pixel to insert in the image. The
                    advantage
                    of raster images that you can modify it very precisely, pixel by pixel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>vector image</i> - doesn't have fixed size of pixels. The lines on an image are represented by
                    vectors,
                    because of this reason it can be scaled infinitely and will not loose quality. The bad side is
                    that
                    vector images are not so color detailed as raster (bitmap) images.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can use both vector and raster images on your website. How to add an image you can read it
                on my first-week post <a href="#w1_add_image">add an image</a>.

                I decided to write an extra article about tools which I used for creating this website.

                <h3>week 6 - introduction to responsive web design</h3>

                <p class="published">Published on
                    <time datetime="2015-11-14">November 14, 2015</time>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This week I learned about <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr> - Responsive Web
                    Design,
                    more particularly why do we need it and about three main
                    <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr> techniques.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p id="w6_why_RWD">
                    So why we need <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr>, wouldn't be easier just to create
                    websites which are fixed size and non-responsive? The answer is "yes" it would be easier, and
                    this
                    approach was the best for more than 20 years. The main issue with fixed layout is that it can't
                    accommodate increasing variety of mobile phones and tablets. And as you can see from the graph below
                    people
                    use more phones to connect to the Internet than laptops. Responsive web design provides
                    techniques
                    for designers to create a website which will look good on all these devices.

                <hr/>
                <p id="w6_viewport">
                    Viewport attribute - first thing for <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr> is to
                    include
                    <i class="attr">viewport</i> attribute for <i class="tag">meta</i> element in document's <i
                        class="tag">head</i>
                </p>
                    <pre><code><!--
                --><span class="tag">&lt;meta</span>&nbsp;<!--
                --><span class="att">name</span>=<!--
                --><span class="value">&quot;viewport&quot;</span>&nbsp;<!--
                --><span class="att">content</span>=<!--
                --><span class="value">&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;</span>&nbsp;<!--
                --><span class="value">/&gt;</span>&nbsp;<!--
                --></code></pre>
                <p>
                    <i>width=device-width</i> - instructs browser to render viewport size to device-width. So that
                    mobile
                    browser will behave the same as desktop one. Width value can be specific pixel size like
                    width=600.
                    <i>initial-scale=1"</i> – tells the browser to render the webpage at full-size when it's
                    loaded,
                    rather than scaling it down. The <i>maximum-scale</i>, <i>minimum-scale</i>, and
                    <i>user-scalable</i>
                    properties control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p id="w6_media_query">
                    The second thing is <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> media queries, which allow you to
                    apply
                    <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> rules specific to the width of the device. The query
                    can check
                    not just width, but height, orientation such as landscape or portrait, resolution and more. This
                    way
                    you have a lot of options to control how your website looks on a particular device. These queries
                    work very simple:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First they check how big the screen is.</li>
                    <li>And then they apply those <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> rules, which are for
                        that size of the screen.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Let's say I want my desktop version web page would have an <i class="tag">aside</i> element, but
                    I
                    don't
                    want it on mobile version, so my <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> would look
                    something
                    like this:
                </p>
                <pre><code><!--
                --><span class="att">@media&nbsp;</span><!--
                --><span class="tag">&nbsp;only&nbsp;screen&nbsp;</span><!--
                --><span>and &nbsp;(</span><!--
                --><span class="tag">max-width:&nbsp;400px</span><!--
                --><span>)&nbsp;{</span>&nbsp;&NewLine;<!--
                -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>aside&nbsp;{</span>&nbsp;<!--
                --><span class="tag">display:&nbsp;</span><!--
                --><span class="att">none;&nbsp;</span><!--
                --><span>}</span>&NewLine;}<!--
                --></code></pre>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i class="att">@media</i> - tells the browser that this is media query.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i class="tag">only</i> - is for older browsers, which do not support media query.
                        <i class="tag">only</i> will hide this query from them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i class="tag">screen</i> - targets devices which have a screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>and - logical AND operator which applies these rules only then left side of media query
                        (screen
                        only) and right hand side (max-width: 400px) are both true.,
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="tag">max-width: 400px</i> - targets devices with a width of 400px and less, that means
                        if
                        the screen is smaller than 400px it will hide <i class="tag">aside</i> element.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Note that on my web page I used little bit different media query. Instead of using
                    <i class="tag">max-width</i> I used <i class="tag">min-width: 34rem</i>, which applies rules
                    only
                    when
                    screen is equal or bigger than 34rem. Because I started to develop my website for mobile
                    devices
                    and then gradually increased size. It is easier to add content as screen size grows rather
                    shrink
                    it.

                <p class="published">Published on
                    <time datetime="2015-10-31">October 31, 2015</time>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This week I learned about <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> cascade, box model, and
                    measurements. Also, I styled some <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> elements
                    <i class="tag">body</i> and <i class="tag">header</i>.
                </p>
            </header>
            <hr/>
            <p id="w5_css_cascade">
                So what exactly is <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> cascade?
                Every time when we write a <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> rule, that rule may be applied
                not
                just one <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> element, in fact, most of the time it
                is
                applied to many elements. Most important factor of deciding how rules are applied is selector's
                specificity, it means that if a selector is more specific it overrides more general selector. If two
                selectors are identical, then last defined in the stylesheet will take precedence. Of course, sometimes
                you
                want to break this rules, and you can do it with <i class="tag">!important</i> keyword after the value.
                And this rule can not be overridden by any other rule.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p id="w5_box_model">
                <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> sees all elements as boxes. And all boxes have three
                things:
                border, margin and padding. The main thing which is in the middle of the box is an actual content,
                it
                can be text in <i class="tag">h1</i> element link in
                <i class="tag">a</i> element. Some boxes may not
                have content or it may be not visible. Padding is a space which surrounds a content it may be zero
                or as
                much big as you want to be, after padding, comes a border and margin. Margin is a space between
                other
                elements in a page. By specifying margin and padding we can control how much empty space is on a
                page.
                Don't be afraid to put more space, it helps for readability as well as find things which is more
                important.

            <p id="w5_measurements">
                <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> has many units of measurements some are relative (em,
                rem,
                %, ex..) and absolute (cm, mm, in, px..). We shouldn't use absolute units in
                <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr> so I will not mention them, except pixels (px).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i> % (percentage)</i> - Defines a measurement as a percentage relative to another element,
                    usually, it is an enclosing element. Best usage is for layouts, on my site I used this element to
                    position
                    <i class="tag">main</i> and <i class="tag">aside</i> elements side by side so that
                    <i class="tag">main</i>
                    occupies 60% and <i class="tag">aside</i> - 40% space of enclosing
                    <i class="tag">div</i>. Also,
                    I used <i>%</i> do define root element's font size. So if
                    <i class="tag">html</i> element font-size
                    property is 100%, then real font-size is equal to default browser's font size which in most
                    cases
                    is 16px.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>em</i> - Defines a measurement relative to font size of that element. Let's say font size of
                    <i class="tag">body</i> is 16px, so 1em will be 16px, 2em-32px. And we don't have any problem
                    with
                    this unit until we start using this to define font size. Let's say a
                    <i class="tag">body</i> has
                    a font-size of 2em, and we want a
                    <i class="tag">header</i> to be twice as big as any element in the
                    <i class="tag">body</i> so the logic would suggest making <i class="tag">header</i> element
                    4em,
                    but that wouldn't be correct. Because
                    <i class="tag">header</i> element inherited font size of 2em,
                    from its enclosing
                    <i class="tag">body</i> element. And 4em relative to 2em altogether is 8em. The
                    Correct way would be to set up
                    <i class="tag">header</i> element to 2em, and it will have twice as
                    big font size as <i class="tag">body</i> element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>rem</i> - Is very similar to <i>em</i> and defines a measurement relative to <em>ROOT</em>
                    element font size, which in <i class="tag">html</i> element. Because
                    <i>rem</i> is very flexible and
                    doesn't have pitfalls as <i>em</i> is a perfect for
                    <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr>.
                    For this reason, I used this measurement extensively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>ex</i> - Is a measurement relative to a font's x-height, which is the height of font's lowercase
                    letter
                    x. This is unit is not very popular, and I don't see any reason to use
                    <i>ex</i> instead of
                    <i>em</i> or <i>rem</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>px</i>- It is the relative measurement to the resolution to the screen on the device. This unit
                    was
                    the most popular between web designers because it gave the most control of how a page will be
                    displayed
                    on screens. And it was ok for a decade because most devices had very similar pixel density.
                    Unfortunately
                    now new devices such as smartphones have four times bigger resolution than an old monitor. In other
                    words,
                    physical pixels became much smaller.
                    And that's the way it is not suitable for <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr>.

                <p>
                    This week I started to learn
                    <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>. This includes syntax, selectors,
                    how to attach an external file to the
                    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> document etc. I decided to go with the
                    minimalistic design. But to make it look good, I had to learn more about typographic and color
                    palettes. So let's get started.
                </p>
            </header>
            <hr/>
            <p id="w4_external_css">
                It is always better to attach external style sheet rather embed a style in the
                <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> markup. This will make maintenance of your
                site
                much easier.
                You do this in the
                <i class=tag>head</i>, with
                <i class=tag>link</i> element. Attribute <i class=att>href</i> points to a file with
                <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> rules,
                <i class=att>rel</i> - specifies relationship between a document and a file which is attached to it, and
                <i class=att>type</i> - a type of file.
            </p>
             <pre><code><!--
                --><span class="tag">&lt;link</span>&nbsp;<!--

                --></code></pre>
            <hr/>
            <p id="w4_reset_vs_normalize">
                Every browser has their own way of displaying
                <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> elements. Older one's may not even recognize
                new
                elements. And this is a problem, because even if you make your own stylesheet, different browsers
                display it differently. The solution for this problem is to use reset or normalize
                <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>.
                Which is external first external stylesheet attached to the page.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Reset stylesheet removes all borders, margins from elements, makes some inline elements to be
                    block
                    etc. In other words, it resets all values of elements to zero and you start styling those
                    elements
                    as new. I used this -
                    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/html5resetcss/downloads/detail?name=html5reset-1.6.1.css&can=2&q=">
                        reset.css </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Normalize in other hand doesn't reset all default values. It fixes some bugs, especially with
                    new <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> elements. Personally, I prefer reset.css
                    rather normalize.css because it gives you more control over elements. You can find
                    here <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr/>
            <p id="w4_css_selectors">
                One disadvantage of putting all your styles in the external file is that it has to target
                <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> elements. We doing that with selectors and the good
                news is that <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> has plenty of selectors.

            <p id="w4_typography">
                One of the most neglected thing in web design is typography. But what exactly that is? I always
                thought
                that is just about a font, but is not. It is more like an art of displaying text. It involves page
                layout,
                space between paragraphs, words, lines letters, margins, text formatting, text composition etc. Very
                good resource of learning about all of this is <cite>Typography for Lawyers</cite> by Matthew
                Butterick,
                you can buy it at Amazon
                <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Typography-Lawyers-Matthew-Butterick/dp/1598390775">
                    Typography for Lawyers</a> or read it online
                <a href="http://practicaltypography.com">http://practicaltypography.com</a>.
                Most important typography rules which I used on my Learning Journal are
            </p>

            <p class="spec">
                Font size should be between 15-25px. I decided to go with responsive font size, for this reason,
                I used em's measurements. Which is relative size to the browser default font size, which in most
                cases are 16px. Usually, people small devices (phones, tablets) use not far away from their eyes,
                that's way font can be smaller 15px, but when we increase device screen size the distance from their
                eyes and screen increases as well, and we have to increase font size.
            </p>

            <p>
                Very important measurement is line length. Which is character count including spaces on the line.
                On average length should be between 45-90 characters. Of course, when developing sites, it would be
                ridiculous to count every character when you make a change. The easiest way is to create two strings
                45 and 90 characters long and see how they wrap on the line. To have even more control of line
                length
                you can set min and max values to the container, this way the length of the line will not be less than
                45
                and
                more than 90.
            </p>

            <p class="spec">
                Don't use default fonts such as Arial or Verdana as well as goofy looking fonts. It is good to use
                them
                for page titles, but not for main content unless you really want to scare your visitors that they
                would not come back to your site again. The best option is to use professional looking fonts, but
                of course, for most of them, you have to pay. The alternative would be to use
                <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">google fonts</a>. For my journal, I decided to go with classic
                looking
                font EB Garamond which you can find at
                <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:EB+Garamond">
                    EB Garamond </a>. One disadvantage of using online font's that they have to be downloaded before
                use
                and that may slow down your site. Also don't use more than three fonts per site.
            </p>

            <p>
                Don't be afraid of white space, letter spacing should be between 120-145% of font size, don't use
                underlining, use bold or italic sparingly and there are much more recommendations for your text to
                look professional. Again I recommend read this at
                <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/">http://practicaltypography.com</a>.
                One good way of choosing fonts for your website is to check others people website. And if you using
                Chrome you can download extension
                <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en">
                    what font</a> which lets you find out what font is being used on the site.

                <p>
                    This is the third week since I started to learn <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr>.
                    And I could say that I am getting a good grasp of it.
                    While my site still does not look very attractive and doesn't have a lot of content, but the
                    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> code looks pretty good.
                    I finished reading all the chapters about
                    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> in the
                    <cite>HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites</cite> by Jon Duckett, which covered rest of
                    elements.
                    So this week I learned how to ...

                <i class=tag>main</i> element marks
                main content of your page. Inside
                <i class=tag>main</i> you can contain sectioning elements such as
                <i class=tag>article</i> or <i class=tag>section</i>. Because every page has only one main content
                you shouldn't use more than one <i class=tag>main</i> element in a page. On another hand
                <i class=tag>aside</i>
                is different. It can be used more than once. Although there are two ways of using it.

                are very similar, but they are not interchangeable. The section is more general which represents
                document's
                section under a generic heading. Very good example is in newspapers under advertisement heading
                where
                we have different advertisements for cars. The <i class=tag>section</i> shouldn't
                be used only for styling purposes, for that we have <i class=tag>div</i> element, also, a
                <i class=tag>section</i>
                should have a heading (for the difference between <i class=tag>header</i> and <i class=tag>h1</i> -
                <i class=tag>h2</i> you can find on my previous post <a href="#w1_headers">here</a>). The
                <i class=tag>article</i> is
                a more specific type of
                <i class=tag>section</i> element. On newspaper analogy advertisement for a specific car would
                be an article. Always try to use more specific element <i class=tag>article</i> instead of
                more general <i class=tag>section</i> whenever is possible.

                which clearly explains about the <i class=tag>head</i> element and it's attributes. Unlike other
                <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> elements, a <i class=tag>head</i> is not
                directly visible to the user, but that doesn't mean that is not important. The <i class=tag>head</i>
                contains metadata about the document which is used by web browsers. Elements which you can find inside
                <i class=tag>head</i> are -
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i class=tag>title</i> - Is page title. It is visible on top of browser window.

                <li>
                    <i class=tag>meta</i> - Is page's metadata. It can contain these attributes (<i
                        class=att>charset</i>,
                    <i class=att>content</i>, <i class=att>name</i>, <i class=att>http-equiv</i>,
                    <i class=att>scheme</i>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class=tag>style</i> - Defines <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheed">CSS</abbr> rules. Please note
                    that is always better to put all your
                    <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheed">CSS</abbr> to the external
                    document and link it with <i class=tag>link</i> element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class=tag>link</i> - Is used for linking stylesheets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class=tag>script</i> - To include javascript.

                <li>
                    <i class=tag>noscript</i> - Useful if the browser doesn't support script or it is disabled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class=tag>base</i> - Specifies base <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> for all
                    relative URL's contained inside the document.

            </ul>
            <p>
                I didn't mention two important things. One of them is global <i class=att>lang</i> attribute, which
                is used to specify element's language. A good practice is to include this attribute inside
                <i class=att>html</i>
                tag. Another thing is <i class=tag>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</i> declaration. Which is not an element,
                but
                an instruction for web browser about what version of <abbr
                    title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
                page is written in. Declaration should be first thing in a document.

                    The second week was very busy for me. I bought a
                    <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Sites/dp/1118008189">
                        HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Web Sites</a></cite> book, by Jon Duckett
                    and read few chapters.
                    Managed to connect to my W:\ drive remotely.
                    Arranged my web site's files and folders, by creating a new folder for images in my Web$ workspace
                    on
                    the
                    <a href="http://itsuite.it.brighton.ac.uk/">University of Brighton server</a>.
                    Also, at lab tutorial finished all exercises and ended up with a well marked up journal.
                    After the second week I learned how to do the following things:

                Use <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> character entities references such as

                or &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;.
                You can do that by first specifying &ldquo;&amp;&num;&rdquo; followed by Unicode code point in
                hexadecimal or
                decimal notation. Or &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; followed by the name. All entities must end with
                semicolon &ldquo;&semi;&rdquo;.

                Correctly use text-level semantics <i class=tag>i</i>, <i class=tag>b</i>, <i class=tag>em</i>,
                <i class=tag>strong</i>, <i class="tag">small</i>, <i class="tag">abbr</i>, <i class="tag">mark</i>
                elements. Which can be very confusing at first sight.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i class=tag>i</i> - represents a text which has an alternate voice or mood. Something that is
                    different in some
                    kind of way, like translated foreign word, musical notation or voice-over.
                    It is a good practice to include
                    <i class=att>class</i> attribute explaining what is exactly different
                    (alternate voice).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class=tag>b</i> - represents a text which should be marked different from the text, but without
                    any
                    emphasis or
                    alternate voice, such as abstract keywords or product names in a review. In other words, if you
                    want
                    to make text look different. Use this if there is no better substitute for marking up such as
                    <i class=tag>h1</i> for headings, <i class=tag>var</i> for mathematical variables. Also, when
                    using
                    <i class=tag>b</i>
                    is good practice to include a <i class=att>class</i> attribute to indicate why the
                    <i class=tag>b</i> element is being used.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class=tag>em</i> - represents emphasis of its content. It's used mostly for change the
                    meaning of
                    the
                    sentence. Note that
                    <i class="tag">em</i> shouldn't convey an importance, for that we have the
                    <i class="tag">strong</i> element, also, it shouldn't be used for just
                    italic text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="tag">strong</i> - is used to represent strong importance, like a warning or caution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="tag">small</i> - for small print, such as disclaimers, legal restrictions or
                    copyright. It
                    shouldn't be used for subheadings or extended text such as a paragraph. Also strangely, but
                    <i class="tag">small</i> don't de-emphasize the importance of the text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="tag">abbr</i> - used to mark up abbreviation or acronym.
                    <i class="att">title</i> specifies
                    full acronym or abbreviation. Try
                    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> abbreviation
                    (hover on word &ldquo;HTML5&rdquo; to see an effect).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="tag">mark</i> - used to mark a text in one context which is relevant in another
                    context
                    for reference purpose. It is similar to when you read a book, you're highlighting a text, so
                    that
                    when you take the
                    same book again you can easily identify important things which you highlighted before.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p id="w2_using_lists">
                Include ordered, unordered and definition lists, using <i class=tag>ol</i>, <i class=tag>ul</i> and
                <i class=tag>dl</i>. The difference
                between ordered and unordered list is that ordered list is used for things which can be ordered and
                by
                default browser will use digits to show order. But you can change that with
                <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS3</abbr>.
                A list item is marked up within a
                <i class=tag>li</i> element. A definition list is mostly used for listing some terms
                followed by a description. <i class=tag>dt</i> stands for definition term and

                    I had some experience with
                    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
                    before this course, that is way first week lab tutorial was not very hard to follow.
                    I ended up with a 2-page 'website'. Even it uses latest
                    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> tags such as
                    <i class=tag>article</i> or
                    <i class=tag>header</i>
                    it does not look very appealing. In fact, it looks very old.
                    But I have no doubt that my web site's appearance will improve in following weeks,
                    and especially when I start to learn
                    <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS3</abbr>.
                    So to sum up in this week, I learned how to do the following things:
                </p>

            <p id="w1_validation">
                Validate <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr>
                using the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> validator.
                Which you can find
                <a href="http://validator.w3.org">here</a>. This is the first thing which you have to do after
                creating your
                <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> document. Validator will check your document
                syntax errors. Event browsers can render non-valid <abbr
                    title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr>
                documents is very good practice to do so. Because when a browser meets some unusual construct, it
                will
                make
                a guess how this supposed to be shown and the result might be not what you intended. At
                <a href="http://validator.w3.org">validator</a> page you can specify an URI, upload a
                file or just copy and paste your
                <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> code.
            </p>

            <p id="w1_linking">
                Create links to external websites with <i class=tag>a</i> anchor using absolute links. To do that
                you
                have to specify and address using <i class=att>href</i> attribute.
                <i class=att>href</i> value is the address of the site which
                you are pointing your link at. Between
                <i class=tag>a</i> opening and closing tags goes a text which you click on
                as
                <a href="http://html5doctor.com">HTML5 Doctor</a>. If you have a bunch of links grouped together in
                the
                same
                element especially for main sites navigation, you can use
                <i class=tag>nav</i> tag, which stands for navigation.
            </p>

            <p class="spec">
                To create a link pointing to the different page of your website you can use relative or absolute
                links.
                The difference between
                them is not visible to the user and both can point to the same page. The advantage of using
                relative links is that it is easier to maintain. Let's say you decided to change your domain
                address.
                With
                absolute links you will have to go through all your links and change them individually, with
                relative -
                not.
            </p>

            <p>
                To point to the different position within a page you do the same thing as with pointing to a
                different website using <i class=tag>a</i> with <i class=att>href</i> attribute. The difference is that
                <i class=att>href</i> will contain
                &ldquo;#&rdquo; followed by element address specified by the
                <i class=att>id</i> attribute which has to be unique for
                the page. That means that same <i class=att>id</i> can't point to different elements.
                Try <a href="#top">go to top of the page</a>.
            </p>

                <li>
                    <i class=tag>header</i> - is used to represent section header and can contain headings,

                    logos, tables etc. Important to note, that
                    <i class=tag>header</i> doesn't introduce a new section, but is a head of a section. If a header
                    contains only

                <li>

                    represented
                    by number in their name. Starting from highest - 1 and smallest - 6.
                    <i class=tag>h1</i> is used for main page heading,
                    <i class=tag>h2</i> for section heading and so on. Important thing to
                    remember is not to use <i class=tag>h1</i> -
                    <i class=tag>h6</i> for subheadings or subtitles.

                Structure paragraphs with
                <i class=tag>p</i>. This element is used for grouping content. <i class=tag>p</i> is more general
                grouping element, and shouldn't be used for lists or quotes. By default browser will insert a blank
                line
                between
                paragraphs, but you can change that behaviour with <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS3</abbr>
                To separate content, even more, you can insert
                <i class=tag>hr </i> (paragraph-level break). Which is used to separate paragraphs in an
                <i class=tag>article</i> or a
                <i class=tag>section</i>. <i class=tag>hr </i> shouldn't be used to separate sectioning

                <i class=tag>section</i> or

                to
                not forget <i class=tag>figure</i> element which may contain any kind of figure (diagram,
                illustration,
                chart, photo). To contain images in the <i class=tag>figure</i> you use <i class=tag>img </i> tag with
                attributes like <i class=att>alt</i>, which value will be used to display a
                text, if the browser will fail to load an image. And the last thing to remember is to
                include
                <i class=tag>figcaption</i> which can be a short description for an image or author's details.

                <i class=att>target</i> attribute, link will be opened in the same browser
